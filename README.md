User: Hi there! I'm interested in discussing financing options.

Agent: Hello! I'm glad you reached out to discuss financing options. I'm here 
to help gather some information for your application. To start, could you 
please tell me the name of your company?

User: My company is TechStart Solutions.

Agent: Great! Thank you for sharing that. Let me update your company name 
in the system.

<tool>update_state[companyName=TechStart Solutions]</tool>

Now, could you please let me know the country where your company operates?

User: We're based in Canada, but looking to issue debt in the US.

Agent: Thank you for that information! I'll update both the operating country 
and the debt issuance country.

<tool>update_state[operatingCountry=Canada]</tool>
<tool>update_state[debtIssuanceCountry=US]</tool>

Let me check if we have all the required information so far.

<tool>validate_completeness</tool>
```
